# Hafiza Architecture

## Overview

Hafiza is built on a modular architecture that emphasizes type safety, extensibility, and performance. The core design follows these principles:

1. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of TypeScript generics and type inference
2. **Immutability**: State changes are always immutable
3. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture through middleware system

## Core Components

### Store
The central state container with the following responsibilities:
- State management
- Action dispatching
- Subscription handling
- Type safety enforcement

```typescript
interface Store<S extends State> {
  getState(): S;
  dispatch(action: Action<S>): Promise<void>;
  subscribe(subscriber: Subscriber<S>): () => void;
  select<R>(selector: Selector<S, R>): R;
}
```

### Computed Values
System for derived state calculations:
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Memoization
- Lazy evaluation
- Cache invalidation

```typescript
interface ComputedValue<S extends State, R> {
  (state: S): R;
  dependencies: Set<string>;
}
```

### Middleware System
Extensible middleware architecture:
- Priority-based execution
- Dependency management
- Async action support
- Composition utilities

```typescript
type Middleware<S extends State> = (
  api: MiddlewareAPI<S>
) => (
  next: (action: Action<S>) => Promise<void>
) => (
  action: Action<S>
) => Promise<void>;
```

## Data Flow

1. **Action Dispatch**
   ```
   Action -> Middleware Chain -> Store -> State Update -> Subscribers
   ```

2. **Computed Value Updates**
   ```
   State Change -> Dependency Check -> Recomputation -> Cache Update
   ```

3. **Middleware Processing**
   ```
   Action -> Pre-processors -> Core Logic -> Post-processors -> Next Middleware
   ```

## Type System

### Core Types
```typescript
type State = Record<string, any>;

interface Action<S extends State = State> {
  type: string;
  payload?: any;
}

type AsyncAction<S extends State = State> = {
  type: string;
  payload?: Promise<any>;
};
```

### Middleware Types
```typescript
interface MiddlewareAPI<S extends State> {
  getState: () => S;
  dispatch: (action: Action<S>) => Promise<void>;
}

type Middleware<S extends State> = (api: MiddlewareAPI<S>) => 
  (next: (action: Action<S>) => Promise<void>) => 
  (action: Action<S>) => Promise<void>;
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Computed Values**
   - Dependency tracking using Proxy
   - Selective recomputation
   - WeakMap-based caching

2. **State Updates**
   - Immutable updates
   - Batch processing
   - Minimal re-renders

3. **Middleware**
   - Async action batching
   - Priority-based execution
   - Dependency-based ordering

## Development Tools

1. **Time Travel Debugging**
   - State history tracking
   - Action replay
   - State snapshot management

2. **DevTools Integration**
   - Redux DevTools support
   - State inspection
   - Action logging
   - Time travel UI

## Error Handling

1. **Type Safety**
   - Compile-time type checking
   - Runtime type validation
   - Type guard utilities

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Action validation
   - State integrity checks
   - Middleware error boundaries

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - State sharding
   - Lazy loading
   - Worker thread support

2. **Framework Integration**
   - React bindings
   - Vue.js integration
   - Framework agnostic core

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Transaction support
   - Offline persistence
   - Real-time sync
